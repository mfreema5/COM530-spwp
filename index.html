              I am a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in the Master's program for Technical Communication and Information Design.  I choose the IIT program because, in my opinion, it is keeping pace with the changes in both the nature and medium of communication in the world.  These changes are largely driven by technology and the program at IIT is incorporating that technology into its TCID program.  One of my academic experiences I discuss below came from a course on “User Experience Research and Evaluation”, and this web page itself started as a project for a course on “Standards Based Web Design.”

              In my graduate studies at IIT, it often feels as if—instead of learning answers—I'm merely learning more questions.  Or, rather, I'm learning <em>better</em> questions, which will hopefully be the <em>right</em> questions.  And I'm gaining skills which will be useful both in finding precise answers to the “right” questions, and in developing and implementing practical solutions based on those answers.<span class="o1024">Speaking of practical solutions, the research question for my master's thesis is: <i>How can you identify when practitioners take notice of research? Can you quantify this “practical impact”?</i></span>

              For a group project in the course “User Experience Research and Evaluation”, we looked at the process that parents use to select and enroll their children in Chicago Public Schools.  It turns out to be a much more involved and convoluted process than most people (including those of use on the team) expect.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the “SortCPS” project, we had to create a work flow diagram that traced how information and documents moved between the people involved in the process.  However, unlike the work flow diagram for an office which shows how each employee is involved, SortCPS had at most two parents involved, and typically one of them was on one end of every work flow.  Our first “work flow” diagram looked more like a “work knot” diagram.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then I realized that while there was just one person in the center of everything, we could think of her as taking on a variety of distinct roles.  By charting the flow between those roles, we could sub-divide the process into manageable pieces.  And so for the rest of the project we talked about the tasks done by the “Pref-Cor”, the “App-Cor”, the “Disco-Agent”, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to talk about that contribution I made to SortCPS, because it's and example of what I enjoy doing: finding a solution to a problem that I can share with others.

              While working in the specialty gas industry, I had the opportunity to take part in the design and implementation of the documentation system for a lab that was becoming ISO 17025 certified.  The ISO standards have various requirements for controlling documentation<span class="o1024">, which include control who can revise documents, who approves revisions, and ensuring that only the most recent revision of a document is available for use</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that those requirements can be easily met through a wiki.<span class="o1024">  So I established an internal wiki using the MoinMoin wiki engine, with each wiki page being a document in the quality system documentation.  Not only did this make all of the documentation easily accessible to every employee, but it was therefore also easily searchable, so that people could find the document they needed.</span>  The wiki automatically kept track of all revisions to each document, and by default displayed the most recent revision.  User accounts requiring passwords controlled who had the authority to make changes to documents.

              As part of my various jobs in the industrial, medical and specialty gas industry, I have had to work with both voluntary standards such as ISO 9001, and government regulations such as the FDA regulations concerning medical drugs and devices.
            </p>

              <span class="o1024">While I was a quality assurance chemist at a plant which produced and packaged high purity gases for the semiconductor industry, the plant was certified to the ISO 9001 standard for Quality Management.  Later I was transfered to another plant where I was both the lab manager and quality manager, and that plant was also certified as complying with ISO 9001.  At that plant I was also responsible for verifying conformance to FDA regulations, in the production, testing and labeling of medical drugs (typical pure oxygen) and devices (e.g., calibration standards for medical equipment).</span><span class="u1024">I was a chemist at a plant while it was being certified to ISO 9001, and I was lab manager and quality manager at another plant that had been ISO 9001 certified.

            </p>
            <p>
              Also, since compressed gasses are considered hazardous materials, once I took on management roles, I had to be aware of DOT regulations concerning the labeling of products and placarding of vehicles.
            </p>
            <p><span class="o1024">
              I produced a literature review of sorts, based on the Code of Federal Regulations, when the facility at which I was working starting supplying breathing gases to the professional diving industry.  There are surprisingly few regulations on diving gases, but the ones there are manage to be scattered about in the CFR, and often defer to US Department of Defense specifications—so, yet another set of standards/regulation with which I have some experience.
