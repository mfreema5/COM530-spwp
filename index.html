              I am a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in the Master's of Technical Communication and Information Design program.  The research question for my thesis is:

              I'm interested in the (mis)use of multiple regression analysis in academic papers, so I took PSYC 380 ‘Advanced Statistics – Applied Correlation and Regression’ at IIT.  Since it was an undergraduate level course, the credit hours I earned from it can't be applied toward my Master's degree, but I still think it was worth the time as I learned quite a lot about properly applying various regression and correlation methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, for my final project for PSYC 380, I did an analysis of data based on a hypothesis developed by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4hGHWDcAAAAJ&hl=en">Maija Renko</a>, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at UIC.  The data came from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (<a href="http://www.psed.isr.umich.edu/psed/home">PSED-II</a>).  I employed a response-surface analysis technique (per <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-010-9183-4">Shanock, <i>et al.</i> (2010)</a>), and the results were promising enough that professor Renko has received research funding to expand it into a research article.
